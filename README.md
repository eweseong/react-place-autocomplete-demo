# React Place Autocomplete Demo

This application is a demo of [Google Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-autocomplete) + [Google Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript) in React + Vite + TypeScript.

As Google Map APIs are no longer free, you would need to provide an [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and [Map ID](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/get-map-id) in order to see the application in action.

example: https://eweseong.github.io/react-place-autocomplete-demo?apiKey=API_KEY&mapId=MAP_ID
